# Neuroevolution4j

This is based off of http://ryangrossGitHub.github.io/NeuralRocketLander, go there to check out a quick demo in the browser (This app is server-side).

While I used concepts from the javascript neural net code, this was completely re-written to be more simplistic and to take advantage of Java's more structured style.

The reason to go server-side is you can have 2 tabs open at once, and both clients are making the in memory network better. For large projects you could have thousands of clients to speed up experimentation.

### Next steps

1) Setup a DB to persist the network
2) Move code base to serverless infrastructure : )
